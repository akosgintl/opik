# Problem statement and requirements

Add the ability for non-technical users to review traces/threads. More in PRD - [https://www.notion.so/cometml/Improved-Human-Annotation-Flows-24c7124010a380638fe4f9c0d58c620d#24c7124010a380d58c53da7a2c7b7c79](https://www.notion.so/Improved-Human-Annotation-Flows-24c7124010a380638fe4f9c0d58c620d?pvs=21)

Epik - https://comet-ml.atlassian.net/browse/OPIK-2288

# MVP Goals

Satisfy requirements for v0.1 - [https://www.notion.so/cometml/Improved-Human-Annotation-Flows-24c7124010a380638fe4f9c0d58c620d?source=copy_link#2547124010a3803c9660d2e5ad5df075](https://www.notion.so/Improved-Human-Annotation-Flows-24c7124010a380638fe4f9c0d58c620d?pvs=21)

**NOTE:** The invocation flow will look different.

1. Admin user uses the "Invite a teammate" functionality, after which the SME user will have access to all Opik features as an admin.
2. Admin user shares a link to the target queue with the SME separately.

This flow is changed because the SME user needs access to the workspace to use existing endpoints. 

# MVP Non-goals

- Not adding new user roles to products
- No need for support for the self-hosted version, because we donâ€™t have users concept there


# High-level design

The feature will be controlled by the feature fag `annotation_queues`

## UI Design

UI design described here with wireframes - https://app.excalidraw.com/l/5xGPZ1ID0vQ/7GuSFPxmzzq

## API specification

### AnnotationQueue

The next resource should be added AnnotationQueue

```tsx
export interface AggregatedFeedbackScore {
  name: string;
  value: number;
}

enum ANNOTATION_QUEUE_SCOPE {
	TRACE = "trace",
	THREAD = "thread"
}

export interface AnnotationQueueReviewer {
  username: string;
  status: number; // number of reviwed items
}

export interface AnnotationQueue {
  id: string;
  project_id: string;
  project_name: string; // should be returned for FE
  name: string;
  description: string;
  instructions: string;
  comments_enabled: boolean;
  feedback_definitions: string[];
  scope: ANNOTATION_QUEUE_SCOPE;
  reviewers?: AnnotationQueueReviewer[]; // virtual field, calculated base on feedback scores added to related traces/threads
	feedback_scores?: AggregatedFeedbackScore[]; // virtual field, calculated base on feedback scores added to related traces/threads
	items_count: number; // number of related items to queue
  created_at: string;
  created_by: string;
  last_updated_at: string;
  last_updated_by: string;
  last_scorred_at: string;
}

```
